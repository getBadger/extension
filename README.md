<h2 id="about-Badger">üéØ About Badger</h2>


Badger was born out of a desire to bring transparency to the online shopping and marketing experience. 
As tech-savvy users ourselves, we recognized the need for tools that empower shoppers and affiliate marketers with clear,
honest information about the digital marketplace.

We're building an all-in-one marketing suite focused on:

* **Unified Workflow:** Websites, apps, community, and AI tools in one place.
* **Effortless Collaboration:** Real-time co-authoring with features like line-level locking.
* **Powerful Knowledge Creation:** Flexible note-taking (Markdown, rich text, infinite canvases, pen support), `LaTeX` 
    support, and more.
* **Smart Organization:** Integrated planning, powerful global search, and knowledge graphs.
* **Revolutionary Version History:** Every change saved.
* **Secure & Private by Design:** Built with cybersecurity precision.


<h2 id="whats-inside-this-monorepo">üì¶ What's Inside This Monorepo?</h2>

This `BadgerExtension` repository is a monorepo that houses the foundational code for Badger:

* **`/app`**:
  * The Badger extension application.
  * Built with **[React](https://react.dev/)** (using **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for the frontend).
  * Provides the cross-platform user interface (Windows, macOS, Linux) and client-side logic.
  * Handles offline-first capabilities and synchronization with the backend.

* **`/server`**:
  * The backend logic and data modules running privately.
  * Written in **Python**.
  * Manages real-time feedback, data persistence, and the detailed data history system.

> **Note:** Directory names are placeholders and may evolve.

<h2 id="current-stage">‚è≥ Current Stage</h2>

Badger and this `BadgerExtension` repository are currently in the **launched live phase**. The code here
represents foundational work and is subject to significant changes as we iterate and refine our vision based on
community feedback.
